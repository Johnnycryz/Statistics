STATISTICS

Definition:
Statistics is the study of how to collect, oranise, analyse and interpret numerical 
information and data

Individuals are people or objects included in a study while a variable is a 
characteristics of the individual to be measured or observed

Population is a group of people or object with a common theme

Sample is a small portion of the population, while Census is collecting data from
every individual in a population

Population parameter is a measure that describes the entire population while a 
sample statistic is a measure that describes only a sample of a population

capital N = total population while small n is sample population

Descriptive statistics involves method of organising and summarizing information 
from samples and population.. It can be applied to both sample and population
while inferrring statistics involves methodsof using information from a sample to 
draw conclusion regarding the population..  Inferring statistics only work with 
sample.

Levels of Measurement
Quantitative (numerical) and Qualitative data (characteristics).. 
wherever level the variable falls, they can be
Quantitative data can further be classified into Interval vs Ratio data (Read more)

Qualitative data can be splitted to Nominal vs ordinal data
Nominal applies to categories, labels or names, and cannot be ordered from smallest
to largest while ordinal applies to data that can be arranged in order in categories
but the difference in the categories cannot be measured, even though you can 
arranged them


SAMPLING
Sampling frame is the list of individual from which sample is selected
Undercoverage is omitting members of the population from the sampling frame

Simulation is a numerical facsimile or representation of a real world phenomenon

Types of Sampling

Stratified Sampling 
Systematic Sampling
Cluster Sampling
Convenience Sampling
Multi-stage Sampling
